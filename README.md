Alternative @VRT_NU player

As an exercise in learning #JetpackCompose (and as I wasn't completely happy with the offering of the @VRT), I made my own version of a player for the @VRT_NU streams. Initially Android only, but finally finished of the iOS version as well. Use like you wish, all comments welcome at belgianwaves at gmail dot com
